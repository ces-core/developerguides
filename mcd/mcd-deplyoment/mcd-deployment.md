## Overview

This guide will walk you through deploying MCD protocol to your prefered network.

## Learning Objectives

Here you’ll learn how to deploy your own MCD protocol.

- MCD deployment configuration
- Deployment process

## Pre-requisites

Knowledge in:

- [dapp.tools](http://dapp.tools/)
- [makerdao/dss-deploy-scripts](https://github.com/makerdao/dss-deploy-scripts)
- Testnet ETH kovan/rinkeby/ropsten/goerli

### Dependencies

We need to have `nix` and `dapp.tools` installed on our machine.

- Install `nix`: You can use this [instruction](https://nixos.org/download.html)
- Install `dapp.tools`: ```curl https://dapp.tools/install | sh```
## Sections



### Installation

First of all we will need to clone `dss-deploy-script` repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/makerdao/dss-deploy-scripts.git
cd dss-deploy-scripts
```

The only way to install everything necessary to deploy MCD we need to run

```shell
nix-shell --pure
```

to drop into a Bash shell with all dependency installed.

<h5 style="color: #8a6d3b">Ethereum node</h5>
You'll also need an Ethereum RPC node to connect to. Depending on your usecase, this could be a local node or a remote one.
</div>

### Tokens deplyoment (Optional)

To fully control the tokens that are used in `MCD`, it’s recommended that you deploy and set their prices manually with the help of:

- [dapphub/ds-token: A simple and sufficient ERC20 implementation](https://github.com/dapphub/ds-token) for token deployment
- [dapphub/ds-value: Set and get a value](https://github.com/dapphub/ds-value) for token price value definition

After all preferred tokens and their respective price contract are deployed, you can update the `<NETWORK>.json` file in [config](https://github.com/makerdao/dss-deploy-scripts) folder.

### Configuration

There are 2 main pieces of configuration necessary for a deployment:

- [Ethereum account configuration](#account-configuration)
- [Chain configuration](#chain-configuration)

#### Account configuration

`Seth` relies on the presence of environment variables to know which Ethereum account to use, which RPC server to talk to, etc.

If you're using `nix-shell`, these variables are set automatically for you in [shell.nix](https://github.com/makerdao/dss-deploy-scripts/blob/master/shell.nix).

But you can also configure the below variables manually:

- `ETH_FROM`: address of deployment account
- `ETH_PASSWORD`: path of account password file
- `ETH_KEYSTORE`: keystore path
- `ETH_RPC_URL`: URL of the RPC node

#### Chain configuration

Some networks have a default config file at `config/<NETWORK>.json`, which will be used if non custom config values are set. A config file can be passed via param with flag -f allowing to execute the script in any network (e.g. `dss-deploy testchain -f <CONFIG_FILE_PATH>`). As other option, custom config values can be loaded as an environment variable called `DDS_CONFIG_VALUES`. File passed by parameter overwrites the environment variable.

Below is the expected structure of such a config file:

```json

### MCD Deployment process

Currently, there are default config files for 3 networks:

- [Local testchain](https://github.com/makerdao/dss-deploy-scripts/blob/master/config/testchain.json)
- [Goerli](https://github.com/makerdao/dss-deploy-scripts/blob/master/config/goerli.json)
- [Mainnet](https://github.com/makerdao/dss-deploy-scripts/blob/master/config/main.json)

#### Deploy on local testchain with default config file

```shell
dss-deploy testchain
```

#### Deploy on Goerli with default config file

```shell
dss-deploy goerli
```

#### Deploy on Mainnet with default config file

```shell
dss-deploy main
```

#### Deploy on any network passing a custom config file

```shell
dss-deploy <NETWORK> -f <CONFIG_FILE_PATH>
```

#### Output

Successful deployments save their output to the following files:

- `out/addresses.json`: addresses of all deployed contracts
- `out/config.json`: copy of the configuration file used for the deployment
- `out/abi/`: JSON representation of the ABIs of all deployed contracts
- `out/bin/`: .bin and .bin-runtime files of all deployed contracts
- `out/meta/`: meta.json files of all deployed contracts
- `out/dss-<NETWORK>.log`: output log of deployment

#### Helper scripts

The `auth-checker` script loads the addresses from `out/addresses.json` and the config file from `out/config.json` and verifies that the deployed authorizations match what is expected.

## Smart Contract Dependencies

To update smart contract dependencies use dapp2nix:

```shell
nix-shell --pure
dapp2nix help
dapp2nix list
dapp2nix up vote-proxy <COMMIT_HASH>
```

To clone smart contract dependencies into working directory run:

```shell
dapp2nix clone-recursive contracts
```
